# HurtsCarRental


This is a project I did for my Database Systems, Algorithms and Applications class.

I was tasked with first creating a relational database for a mock rental car company "Hurts". Then I build a UI in Java that system adminstrators would use for tasks like creating a rental, adding a car and processing a return. Unfortunately, because the database was build on our school's Oracle license, the backend is now inaccessible.

Included are both the generators I build to populate the database with test data and the actual user interface.
